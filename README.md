### About

---

This custom Neovim setup, built on the modular framework **NvChad**, provides comprehensive support for **C/C++**, **Assembly**, **Rust**, **Odin**, **Go**, **Python**, and **Lua** programming languages.

Structured primarily in Lua, this environment is designed to offer a **minimalist**, **functional**, and **extensible foundation**, focusing on **performance**, **readability**, and **modular architecture**.

The core objective of this configuration is to serve as a **robust** and **customizable starting point**, facilitating seamless expansion and adaptation to meet specific project requirements or developer workflows.
It integrates modern features such as **LSP (Language Server Protocol)**, **linters**, **code formatters**, and **intelligent autocompletion**, fostering a productive and scalable terminal-based development experience.

## Setup on Arch Linux

---

### Backup and Remove Old Nvim Config

---

Backup old nvim config.

	mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-old

Or remove old nvim config.

	rm -rf ~/.config/nvim

Remove local/state and local/share

	rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
	rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim

### Installation

---

Install required packages.

	sudo pacman -S --needed neovim unzip luarocks xclip wl-clipboard

Install the setup.

	git clone https://github.com/d1gg0-dev/neovim-essentials.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim

You can safely remove the .git and image files.

	rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.gitignore
	rm ~/.config/nvim/*.png

#### Post-Installation

---

Once all plugins have been downloaded and synchronized by lazy.nvim, execute the following command within Neovim to install all registered Language Servers, linters, and formatters:

	:MasonInstallAll

To learn more about customizing the UI and theming system (base46) used by NvChad, refer to the internal Neovim documentation:

	:h nvui
 
To force plugin re-synchronization when necessary, use:

	:Lazy sync

#### Complete Uninstallation

---

To fully remove the Neovim setup, including configurations, plugins, and persistent states, execute the following commands:

	rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
	rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
	rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim

**Warning:** This operation is irreversible and will permanently delete all Neovim customizations and user data.
